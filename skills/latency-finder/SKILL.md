# Latency Finder

Automatically discover performance bottlenecks in the Dispatch personal assistant system using a 3-phase architecture: parallel discovery explorers, parallel refinement reviewers, and a compiled report with actionable optimization suggestions.

## When to Use

- User says "find bottlenecks", "what's slow", "latency scan", "performance scan"
- Nightly cron via "--nightly" flag
- After deploying changes that might affect performance
- System feels sluggish or users report slow responses

## Data Sources

The system has 4 key data sources for latency analysis:

1. **Perf JSONL** (`~/dispatch/logs/perf-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`) — Structured timing metrics recorded by `assistant/perf.py`. Daily rotation, 30-day retention. Use `~/dispatch/bin/perf-analyze` CLI for quick summaries, or DuckDB/jq for deeper analysis.

2. **bus.db sdk_events** (`~/dispatch/state/bus.db`, table `sdk_events`) — Per-tool execution traces with session_name, tool_name, duration_ms, is_error, payload. 3-day retention. Indexes on (session_name, timestamp), (event_type), (tool_name).

3. **bus.db records** (`~/dispatch/state/bus.db`, table `records`) — Business events with timestamps. Track message.received -> message.sent latency, session lifecycle timing. 7-day retention.

4. **System resources** — Process memory/CPU, open FDs, WAL file sizes, daemon health logs.

### Healthy Baselines (from perf skill)

| Metric | Good (p95) | Warning | Critical |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| poll_cycle_ms | < 100ms | 100-500ms | > 500ms |
| poll_gap_ms | < 500ms | 500ms-2s | > 2s |
| inject_ms | < 500ms | 500ms-2s | > 2s |
| contact_lookup_ms | < 10ms | 10-50ms | > 50ms |
| message_staleness_ms | < 5s | 5-15s | > 15s |
| send_sms_ms | < 5s | 5-10s | > 10s |
| session_spawn_ms | < 5s | 5-10s | > 10s |
| session_wake_latency_ms | < 2s | 2-5s | > 5s |
| sdk_queue_depth | max < 5 | 5-10 | > 10 |
| messages_batch_size | < 3 | 3-5 | > 5 |
| wal_checkpoint_status | 0 (ok) | — | != 0 |
| tool_execution (Bash) | < 10s | 10-30s | > 30s |
| gemini_vision_ms | varies | — | > 30s |

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Discovery (Parallel Explore Subagents)

Launch **4 parallel Explore subagents** simultaneously. Each focuses on a different latency surface area. All run with `subagent_type="Explore"` and `model="opus"`.

**IMPORTANT: All subagents (both discovery and refinement) MUST use `model: "opus"`.** Never use sonnet or haiku.

**Time window:** Default to last 24 hours. For multi-day scans, adjust queries:
- Perf JSONL: glob `~/dispatch/logs/perf-*.jsonl` and filter by date, or iterate over specific date files
- bus.db: change `-24 hours` to `-48 hours`, `-7 days`, etc. in the `strftime` expressions

#### Explorer 1: Perf Metrics Analysis

Prompt for the Explore subagent:

```
You are a performance analysis agent. Analyze perf metrics for the Dispatch personal assistant system.

1. Start with the perf-analyze CLI for a quick summary:
   ~/dispatch/bin/perf-analyze 2>/dev/null
   ~/dispatch/bin/perf-analyze --days 2 2>/dev/null

2. For deeper analysis, use DuckDB on the JSONL files (preferred over jq/awk for percentile calculations):

   # Overall metric health with percentiles
   duckdb -c "
     SELECT metric,
            COUNT(*) as count,
            ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY value), 1) as p50,
            ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY value), 1) as p95,
            ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.99) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY value), 1) as p99,
            ROUND(MAX(value), 1) as max
     FROM read_json_auto('$HOME/dispatch/logs/perf-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl')
     WHERE metric IN ('poll_cycle_ms','poll_gap_ms','inject_ms','contact_lookup_ms',
                       'message_staleness_ms','send_sms_ms','session_spawn_ms',
                       'session_wake_latency_ms','sdk_queue_depth','messages_batch_size',
                       'wal_checkpoint_status','gemini_vision_ms')
     GROUP BY metric
     ORDER BY p95 DESC
   " 2>/dev/null

   # If DuckDB is not installed, fall back to jq:
   # cat ~/dispatch/logs/perf-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl | jq 'select(.metric=="poll_cycle_ms")' ...

3. Tool execution analysis — find slow tools and skills:
   duckdb -c "
     SELECT tool,
            COALESCE(input.skill, '') as skill,
            COALESCE(input.cmd_name, '') as cmd,
            COUNT(*) as calls,
            ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY value), 1) as p50_ms,
            ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY value), 1) as p95_ms,
            ROUND(MAX(value), 1) as max_ms,
            SUM(CASE WHEN is_error THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as errors
     FROM read_json_auto('$HOME/dispatch/logs/perf-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl')
     WHERE metric = 'tool_execution'
     GROUP BY tool, skill, cmd
     HAVING calls >= 3
     ORDER BY p95_ms DESC
     LIMIT 30
   " 2>/dev/null

4. Find the top 20 slowest individual events:
   duckdb -c "
     SELECT ts, metric, value as ms, session, tool,
            COALESCE(input.cmd_name, '') as cmd
     FROM read_json_auto('$HOME/dispatch/logs/perf-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl')
     ORDER BY value DESC
     LIMIT 20
   " 2>/dev/null

5. Regression detection — compare today vs yesterday:
   duckdb -c "
     SELECT metric,
            ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY value), 1) as p95_today
     FROM read_json_auto('$HOME/dispatch/logs/perf-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl')
     WHERE metric IN ('poll_cycle_ms','inject_ms','send_sms_ms','message_staleness_ms','contact_lookup_ms')
     GROUP BY metric
   " 2>/dev/null

   YESTERDAY=$(date -v-1d +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null || date -d "yesterday" +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null)
   if [ -f "$HOME/dispatch/logs/perf-${YESTERDAY}.jsonl" ]; then
     duckdb -c "
       SELECT metric,
              ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY value), 1) as p95_yesterday
       FROM read_json_auto('$HOME/dispatch/logs/perf-${YESTERDAY}.jsonl')
       WHERE metric IN ('poll_cycle_ms','inject_ms','send_sms_ms','message_staleness_ms','contact_lookup_ms')
       GROUP BY metric
     " 2>/dev/null
   fi

6. Check for baselines violations:
   - poll_cycle_ms p95 > 100ms
   - poll_gap_ms p95 > 500ms
   - inject_ms p95 > 500ms
   - contact_lookup_ms p95 > 10ms
   - message_staleness_ms p95 > 5000ms
   - send_sms_ms p95 > 5000ms
   - session_spawn_ms > 10000ms
   - sdk_queue_depth max > 5
   - messages_batch_size > 5 consistently
   - wal_checkpoint_status != 0

7. Return a JSON array of latency candidates:
   [
     {
       "id": "PERF1-001",
       "title": "Short description of the bottleneck",
       "metric": "metric_name",
       "current_p95": 123.4,
       "baseline": 100,
       "severity_guess": "critical|high|medium|low",
       "confidence": "high|medium|low",
       "evidence": "What the data shows and why it matters",
       "affected_sessions": ["session names if specific"],
       "category": "daemon_loop|message_delivery|tool_execution|session_lifecycle|sms_send|queue_backup"
     }
   ]
```

#### Explorer 2: SDK Events Analysis (bus.db)

Prompt for the Explore subagent:

```
You are a tool execution performance analyst. Analyze the sdk_events table in bus.db for slow tool calls and session bottlenecks.

1. Check what data is available:
   sqlite3 ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(datetime(timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime')), MAX(datetime(timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime')) FROM sdk_events"

2. Find the slowest tool executions in the last 24 hours:
   sqlite3 -header ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT session_name, tool_name, duration_ms, is_error,
            datetime(timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime') as time,
            substr(payload, 1, 200) as payload_preview
     FROM sdk_events
     WHERE event_type = 'tool_use'
       AND timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
       AND duration_ms IS NOT NULL
     ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
     LIMIT 30
   "

3. Aggregate tool performance by tool name:
   sqlite3 -header ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT tool_name,
            COUNT(*) as call_count,
            ROUND(AVG(duration_ms), 1) as avg_ms,
            ROUND(MAX(duration_ms), 1) as max_ms,
            SUM(CASE WHEN is_error = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as error_count,
            ROUND(SUM(duration_ms), 0) as total_ms
     FROM sdk_events
     WHERE event_type = 'tool_use'
       AND timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
       AND duration_ms IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY tool_name
     ORDER BY total_ms DESC
   "

4. Find sessions with the most total tool time:
   sqlite3 -header ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT session_name,
            COUNT(*) as tool_calls,
            ROUND(SUM(duration_ms)/1000, 1) as total_seconds,
            ROUND(AVG(duration_ms), 1) as avg_ms,
            ROUND(MAX(duration_ms), 1) as max_ms
     FROM sdk_events
     WHERE event_type = 'tool_use'
       AND timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
       AND duration_ms IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY session_name
     ORDER BY total_seconds DESC
   "

5. Look for error patterns correlated with latency:
   sqlite3 -header ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT tool_name, is_error,
            COUNT(*) as count,
            ROUND(AVG(duration_ms), 1) as avg_ms
     FROM sdk_events
     WHERE event_type = 'tool_use'
       AND timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
       AND duration_ms IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY tool_name, is_error
     HAVING count > 3
     ORDER BY avg_ms DESC
   "

6. Find sequential tool calls with long gaps (Claude thinking time or queue delays):
   sqlite3 ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT s1.session_name,
            datetime(s1.timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime') as t1,
            s1.tool_name as tool1,
            datetime(s2.timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime') as t2,
            s2.tool_name as tool2,
            (s2.timestamp - s1.timestamp - COALESCE(s1.duration_ms, 0)) as gap_ms
     FROM sdk_events s1
     JOIN sdk_events s2 ON s1.session_name = s2.session_name
       AND s2.timestamp > s1.timestamp
       AND s2.id = (SELECT MIN(id) FROM sdk_events WHERE session_name = s1.session_name AND id > s1.id AND event_type = 'tool_use')
     WHERE s1.event_type = 'tool_use'
       AND s1.timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
       AND gap_ms > 10000
     ORDER BY gap_ms DESC
     LIMIT 20
   "

7. Return a JSON array of latency candidates:
   [
     {
       "id": "SDK1-001",
       "title": "Short description of the bottleneck",
       "metric": "tool_execution|inter_tool_gap|session_total_time",
       "tool_name": "tool name if specific",
       "current_value": 123.4,
       "baseline": "expected normal value",
       "severity_guess": "critical|high|medium|low",
       "confidence": "high|medium|low",
       "evidence": "What the data shows",
       "affected_sessions": ["session names"],
       "category": "slow_tool|high_error_rate|excessive_calls|long_gaps|session_bottleneck"
     }
   ]
```

#### Explorer 3: Message Delivery Latency (bus.db records)

Prompt for the Explore subagent:

```
You are a message delivery latency analyst. Measure end-to-end message delivery times using bus.db records. This covers both iMessage and Signal messages.

1. Find message.received -> message.sent pairs to measure response time:
   sqlite3 -header ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT r1.key as chat_id,
            datetime(r1.timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime') as received_at,
            datetime(r2.timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime') as sent_at,
            (r2.timestamp - r1.timestamp) / 1000.0 as response_seconds,
            json_extract(r1.payload, '$.sender_name') as sender,
            r1.source as backend
     FROM records r1
     LEFT JOIN records r2 ON r2.key = r1.key
       AND r2.type = 'message.sent'
       AND r2.timestamp > r1.timestamp
       AND r2.timestamp < r1.timestamp + 300000
       AND r2.id = (SELECT MIN(id) FROM records WHERE key = r1.key AND type = 'message.sent' AND timestamp > r1.timestamp)
     WHERE r1.type = 'message.received'
       AND r1.timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
     ORDER BY response_seconds DESC
     LIMIT 30
   "

2. Find messages that were received but never got a response (within 5 minutes):
   sqlite3 -header ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT r1.key as chat_id,
            datetime(r1.timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime') as received_at,
            json_extract(r1.payload, '$.sender_name') as sender,
            substr(json_extract(r1.payload, '$.text'), 1, 100) as message_preview,
            r1.source as backend
     FROM records r1
     WHERE r1.type = 'message.received'
       AND r1.timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
       AND NOT EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 FROM records r2
         WHERE r2.key = r1.key
           AND r2.type = 'message.sent'
           AND r2.timestamp > r1.timestamp
           AND r2.timestamp < r1.timestamp + 300000
       )
     ORDER BY r1.timestamp DESC
     LIMIT 20
   "

3. Measure session creation to first response time (cold start latency):
   sqlite3 -header ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT r1.key as chat_id,
            datetime(r1.timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime') as session_created,
            datetime(r2.timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime') as first_response,
            (r2.timestamp - r1.timestamp) / 1000.0 as seconds_to_first_response
     FROM records r1
     LEFT JOIN records r2 ON r2.key = r1.key
       AND r2.type = 'message.sent'
       AND r2.timestamp > r1.timestamp
       AND r2.id = (SELECT MIN(id) FROM records WHERE key = r1.key AND type = 'message.sent' AND timestamp > r1.timestamp)
     WHERE r1.type = 'session.created'
       AND r1.timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
     ORDER BY seconds_to_first_response DESC
   "

4. Check for session restart overhead (restarts add latency):
   sqlite3 -header ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT key as chat_id,
            COUNT(*) as restart_count,
            GROUP_CONCAT(datetime(timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime'), ', ') as restart_times
     FROM records
     WHERE type = 'session.restarted'
       AND timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
     GROUP BY key
     ORDER BY restart_count DESC
   "

5. Measure response time by backend (iMessage vs Signal):
   sqlite3 -header ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT r1.source as backend,
            COUNT(*) as messages,
            ROUND(AVG((r2.timestamp - r1.timestamp) / 1000.0), 1) as avg_response_sec,
            ROUND(MAX((r2.timestamp - r1.timestamp) / 1000.0), 1) as max_response_sec
     FROM records r1
     JOIN records r2 ON r2.key = r1.key
       AND r2.type = 'message.sent'
       AND r2.timestamp > r1.timestamp
       AND r2.timestamp < r1.timestamp + 300000
       AND r2.id = (SELECT MIN(id) FROM records WHERE key = r1.key AND type = 'message.sent' AND timestamp > r1.timestamp)
     WHERE r1.type = 'message.received'
       AND r1.timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
     GROUP BY r1.source
   "

6. Note: Message delivery gaps (long quiet periods) are NOT latency issues — they are simply idle periods. Do NOT report quiet periods as bottlenecks. Only report actual slow response times (received -> sent pairs with high latency).

7. Return a JSON array of latency candidates:
   [
     {
       "id": "MSG1-001",
       "title": "Description of the delivery bottleneck",
       "metric": "response_time|time_to_first_response|unanswered|restart_overhead",
       "current_value": 45.2,
       "baseline": "expected seconds",
       "severity_guess": "critical|high|medium|low",
       "confidence": "high|medium|low",
       "evidence": "What the data shows",
       "affected_sessions": ["chat_ids or session names"],
       "category": "slow_response|no_response|cold_start|restart_overhead|signal_specific"
     }
   ]
```

#### Explorer 4: System Resource & Daemon Health

Prompt for the Explore subagent:

```
You are a system resource analyst. Check for resource-related performance issues that affect latency.

1. Check daemon memory and resource usage:
   MANAGER_PID=$(pgrep -f "assistant.manager" | head -1)
   if [ -n "$MANAGER_PID" ]; then
     ps -o pid,rss,vsz,%mem,%cpu,etime -p $MANAGER_PID
     lsof -p $MANAGER_PID 2>/dev/null | wc -l
   fi

2. Check for WAL checkpoint issues (WAL buildup causes slow reads):
   ls -la ~/dispatch/state/bus.db-wal 2>/dev/null
   ls -la ~/Library/Messages/chat.db-wal 2>/dev/null
   # WAL files > 10MB indicate checkpoint delays
   # Also check wal_checkpoint_status metric from perf logs:
   cat ~/dispatch/logs/perf-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl 2>/dev/null | grep '"metric":"wal_checkpoint_status"' | jq -r 'select(.value != 0)' | head -10

3. Check recent poll cycle health:
   cat ~/dispatch/logs/perf-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl 2>/dev/null | grep '"metric":"poll_cycle_ms"' | tail -100 | jq -r '.value' | awk '{sum+=$1; n++; if($1>max)max=$1} END{print "last_100_polls: avg="sum/n, "max="max, "count="n}'

4. Check for CPU-intensive periods (poll_gap_ms > 1000ms = daemon stall):
   cat ~/dispatch/logs/perf-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl 2>/dev/null | grep '"metric":"poll_gap_ms"' | jq -r '[.ts, .value] | @tsv' | awk -F'\t' '$2 > 1000 {print $1, $2"ms"}' | tail -20

5. Check active session count over time:
   cat ~/dispatch/logs/perf-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl 2>/dev/null | grep '"metric":"active_sessions"' | jq -r '[.ts, .value] | @tsv' | tail -20

6. Check for Signal and Sven API health issues:
   sqlite3 ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "
     SELECT datetime(timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime') as time, type,
            json_extract(payload, '$.reason') as reason
     FROM records
     WHERE (type LIKE 'signal%' OR type LIKE 'health.service%')
       AND timestamp > (strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') * 1000)
     ORDER BY timestamp DESC
     LIMIT 20
   "

7. Check sven-api health (bind failures indicate restart loop):
   tail -50 ~/dispatch/logs/sven-api.log 2>/dev/null | grep -i "error\|bind\|failed\|address already in use"

8. Check queue depth trends (sdk_queue_depth > 5 = session falling behind):
   cat ~/dispatch/logs/perf-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl 2>/dev/null | grep '"metric":"sdk_queue_depth"' | jq -r 'select(.value > 3) | [.ts, .value, .session] | @tsv' | tail -20

9. Return a JSON array of latency candidates:
   [
     {
       "id": "SYS1-001",
       "title": "Description of the resource bottleneck",
       "metric": "memory_rss|open_fds|wal_size|poll_gap|cpu_usage|queue_depth|wal_checkpoint",
       "current_value": 123,
       "baseline": "expected value",
       "severity_guess": "critical|high|medium|low",
       "confidence": "high|medium|low",
       "evidence": "What the data shows",
       "category": "memory_pressure|fd_leak|wal_buildup|cpu_contention|service_health|queue_backup"
     }
   ]
```

### Phase 2: Refinement (Parallel Subagents — One Per Candidate)

Collect all latency candidates from the 4 explorers. Deduplicate by metric+category (if two explorers found the same bottleneck, merge them and keep the higher severity version).

For each unique candidate, spawn a **refinement subagent** in parallel. Use `subagent_type="general-purpose"` and `model="opus"` (refinement agents may need to run code, test queries, or read source files to verify root causes).

**Cap at 15 refinement subagents.** If more than 15 candidates, prioritize by: severity_guess (critical first), then confidence (high first), then drop the rest with a note.

Prompt for each refinement subagent:

```
You are a performance verification agent. Investigate this latency candidate and determine if it's actionable.

Latency candidate:
- ID: {id}
- Title: {title}
- Metric: {metric}
- Current value: {current_value}
- Baseline: {baseline}
- Category: {category}
- Confidence: {confidence}
- Evidence from discovery: {evidence}
- Severity guess: {severity_guess}
- Affected sessions: {affected_sessions}

Your job:
1. Verify the data. Run the relevant queries yourself to confirm the numbers.

2. Determine root cause:
   - Is this a code issue (inefficient algorithm, missing index, unnecessary work)?
   - Is this a resource issue (memory pressure, FD exhaustion, WAL buildup)?
   - Is this an architectural issue (polling frequency, serial processing, missing caching)?
   - Is this a transient spike (one-off event, deployment, system restart)?
   - Is this expected behavior (large file, complex query, cold start)?

3. Estimate impact:
   - How many users/sessions are affected?
   - What's the user-visible effect (slow responses, timeouts, dropped messages)?
   - How often does this occur (constant, periodic, rare)?

4. Propose specific fixes with effort estimates:
   - Code change: what file, what function, what to change
   - Config change: what parameter, what value
   - Architecture change: what to redesign

5. Make a verdict:
   - **ACCEPT**: This is a real, actionable performance bottleneck. Root cause identified, fix proposed.
   - **REFINE**: Data is concerning but root cause unclear. Needs monitoring or deeper investigation.
   - **REFUTE**: This is not actionable — expected behavior, transient spike, or within acceptable bounds.

6. Return your verdict as JSON:
   {
     "id": "{id}",
     "verdict": "ACCEPT|REFINE|REFUTE",
     "title": "Final title (may be updated)",
     "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
     "category": "{category}",
     "metric": "{metric}",
     "current_p95": value_or_null,
     "baseline_p95": value_or_null,
     "root_cause": "Why this is slow (ACCEPT only)",
     "impact": "User-visible effect and scope (ACCEPT only)",
     "fix": {
       "description": "What to change",
       "effort": "trivial|small|medium|large",
       "files": ["list of files to modify"],
       "priority": "immediate|next_sprint|backlog"
     },
     "reason": "Why this verdict (especially for REFUTE)"
   }

Be rigorous. A performance issue must cause measurable user-visible impact under normal operating conditions. Do not accept transient spikes, expected cold starts, or theoretical concerns.
```

### Phase 3: Report

Collect all refinement results:
- Drop REFUTE verdicts (note them in a "Refuted" section for transparency)
- Group ACCEPT verdicts by severity: critical > high > medium > low
- List REFINE verdicts as "Needs Investigation"

#### Output Modes

**Interactive mode** (default): Print the report to the conversation.

**Nightly mode** (prompt contains "--nightly"): Send the full report via SMS to admin using the reply CLI or send-sms with the admin's phone looked up from config. Do NOT truncate or summarize — the admin needs full details.

Only send if there are ACCEPT or REFINE verdicts. If everything was refuted or within baselines, skip the SMS and log "latency-finder nightly: clean scan, all metrics within baselines."

**CI mode** (prompt contains "--ci"): Exit with non-zero status if any critical or high bottlenecks are accepted. Print report to stdout.

## Graceful Degradation

- **DuckDB not installed** — Fall back to jq/awk pipelines for perf JSONL analysis. Note the degradation.
- **No perf JSONL for today** — Fall back to yesterday's file, or most recent available. Note the data gap.
- **Empty sdk_events** — Explorer 2 reports "no sdk_events data available" and skips. Other explorers continue.
- **bus.db locked/missing** — Skip bus-dependent explorers, continue with perf JSONL analysis.
- **Explorer subagent fails** — Continue with results from other explorers. Note the failure.
- **Refinement subagent fails** — Note the failure, don't count as accepted or refuted.
- **Zero candidates** — Report "clean scan, all metrics within healthy baselines" (good outcome).
- **Too many candidates (>15)** — Refine top 15 by severity+confidence, list the rest as "unreviewed."

## Calibration

### GOOD latency candidates (report these):
- poll_cycle_ms p95 spiked from 50ms to 300ms after a code change — regression
- poll_gap_ms p95 at 800ms consistently — daemon under CPU pressure
- Bash tool executions averaging 15s for a specific skill — inefficient command
- contact_lookup_ms p95 at 50ms (baseline is 10ms) — cache miss or regression
- Message staleness consistently > 10s — daemon processing delay
- Session cold start takes 30s — slow resume/creation (session_spawn_ms)
- send_sms_ms p95 jumped to 8s — iMessage bottleneck
- sdk_queue_depth consistently > 5 — session falling behind
- messages_batch_size > 5 for sustained periods — message backlog
- Specific session consuming 80% of total tool execution time — resource hog
- Inter-tool gaps > 30s — Claude thinking time or queue starvation
- wal_checkpoint_status != 0 repeatedly — SQLite WAL issues causing slow reads
- Signal messages responding 3x slower than iMessage — backend-specific bottleneck

### BAD candidates (do NOT report):
- Single poll_cycle spike to 200ms during daemon startup — transient
- tool_execution > 30s for a one-time large file download — expected
- Session creation time of 5s on first message — normal cold start
- p50 values slightly above baseline but p95 is fine — not impactful
- Long gap between messages during quiet hours (2am-8am) — idle period, not latency
- One-off gemini_vision_ms spike — Gemini API latency varies

## Examples

```bash
# Scan for performance bottlenecks
"find bottlenecks"
"what's slow"

# Nightly automated scan
"latency scan --nightly"

# Scan with longer time window
"latency scan --since 48h"

# After deploying a change
"check if performance regressed"

# CI check
"latency scan --ci"
```
