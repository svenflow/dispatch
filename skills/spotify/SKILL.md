# Spotify

Spotify integration for the dj-buyer pipeline and general music discovery/recommendation.

**Credentials**: Stored in `~/code/dj-buyer/state.db` (table: `spotify_auth`)
**Client ID**: `43d9bf46f34d48bb80cc23803c8db2a8`
**Account**: see Contacts.app for owner details

## Quick Commands

```bash
cd ~/code/dj-buyer && uv run dj-buyer auth           # Check/trigger re-auth
cd ~/code/dj-buyer && uv run dj-buyer list-tracks <playlist_id>
cd ~/code/dj-buyer && uv run dj-buyer poll           # Poll playlist for new tracks
```

## Token Management

**Token storage**: Access token, refresh token, and expiry in `~/code/dj-buyer/state.db` (`spotify_auth` table). Refresh token also backed up to macOS Keychain: service `spotify-refresh-token`, account `dj-buyer`.

**Auto-refresh**: `get_spotify_client()` refreshes automatically when within 5 minutes of expiry.

**Manual token refresh** (if token stale but refresh token still valid):
```python
import sqlite3, time, requests, base64
# Run from ~/code/dj-buyer
from src.dj_buyer.spotify.auth import get_spotify_secret

client_id = '43d9bf46f34d48bb80cc23803c8db2a8'
client_secret = get_spotify_secret()
db = sqlite3.connect('state.db')
refresh_token = db.execute('SELECT refresh_token FROM spotify_auth LIMIT 1').fetchone()[0]

creds = base64.b64encode(f'{client_id}:{client_secret}'.encode()).decode()
resp = requests.post('https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Basic {creds}', 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
    data={'grant_type': 'refresh_token', 'refresh_token': refresh_token})
data = resp.json()
expires_at = int(time.time()) + data['expires_in']
db.execute('UPDATE spotify_auth SET access_token=?, expires_at=?', (data['access_token'], expires_at))
db.commit()
```

**Keychain recovery**:
```bash
security find-generic-password -a "dj-buyer" -s "spotify-refresh-token" -w
```

**Token health check**: Before background Spotify tasks, validate token first. If expired and refresh fails, notify admin via SMS with re-auth URL — don't silently fail.

## Re-auth Flow (when refresh token is revoked)

Redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:5432/api/spotify_callback` — **CRITICAL: must be `127.0.0.1` not `localhost`**

1. Generate auth URL and SMS to admin:
   ```bash
   cd ~/code/dj-buyer && uv run python -c "
   from src.dj_buyer.config import Config
   from src.dj_buyer.spotify.auth import get_auth_url
   print(get_auth_url(Config.load()))
   "
   ```
2. Admin opens URL on phone, logs in, gets redirected to `http://127.0.0.1:5432/...?code=XXX` (won't load)
3. Admin copies full redirect URL from address bar and pastes back via SMS
4. Exchange code for tokens:
   ```bash
   CLIENT_SECRET=$(cd ~/code/dj-buyer && uv run python -c "from src.dj_buyer.config import get_spotify_secret; print(get_spotify_secret())")
   CREDS=$(echo -n "43d9bf46f34d48bb80cc23803c8db2a8:$CLIENT_SECRET" | base64)
   curl -s -X POST "https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic $CREDS" \
     -d "grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTH_CODE&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:5432/api/spotify_callback"
   ```
5. Save to state.db and keychain:
   ```bash
   EXPIRES_AT=$(($(date +%s) + 3600))
   sqlite3 ~/code/dj-buyer/state.db "DELETE FROM spotify_auth; INSERT INTO spotify_auth (access_token, refresh_token, expires_at) VALUES ('ACCESS_TOKEN', 'REFRESH_TOKEN', $EXPIRES_AT);"
   security add-generic-password -a "dj-buyer" -s "spotify-refresh-token" -w "REFRESH_TOKEN" -U
   ```

## Working API Endpoints

## ReccoBeats API (BPM, Key, Energy — Spotify Replacement)

Free, no auth needed. Accepts Spotify track IDs.

```bash
# Track metadata
curl -s "https://api.reccobeats.com/v1/track?ids=SPOTIFY_ID1,SPOTIFY_ID2"

# Audio features (BPM, key, energy, etc.)
curl -s "https://api.reccobeats.com/v1/audio-features?ids=SPOTIFY_ID1,SPOTIFY_ID2"
```

Returns per track: `tempo` (BPM), `key` (0=C...11=B), `mode` (0=minor, 1=major), `energy`, `danceability`, `valence`, `acousticness`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, `loudness`, `speechiness`

Batch limit: 50 IDs per request. Results in `content` array.

Key mapping: 0=C, 1=C#/Db, 2=D, 3=D#/Eb, 4=E, 5=F, 6=F#/Gb, 7=G, 8=G#/Ab, 9=A, 10=A#/Bb, 11=B

## Creating Playlists

```python
import spotipy, sqlite3, time

db = sqlite3.connect('/Users/sven/code/dj-buyer/state.db')
row = db.execute('SELECT access_token, expires_at FROM spotify_auth LIMIT 1').fetchone()
sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth=row[0])

user_id = sp.me()['id']

# Create playlist
playlist = sp.user_playlist_create(
    user=user_id,
    name="Discover by Sven",
    public=True,
    description="Underground house music curated by Sven"
)
playlist_id = playlist['id']

# Add tracks (list of spotify:track:ID URIs)
sp.playlist_add_items(playlist_id, track_uris)
```

# Nikhil's Taste Profile (as of Apr 2026)

Analyzed 4,268 liked songs across 3,696 unique artists.

## Genre Breakdown

| Rank | Macro Genre | Key Tags | Approx Tag-Hits |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **UK Bass ecosystem** | bass music, dubstep, drumstep, bassline, uk garage, uk funky, grime, stutter house, riddim, bass house, future bass | ~2,800 |
| 2 | **Drum & Bass / Jungle** | drum and bass, jungle, liquid funk, breakbeat | ~1,830 |
| 3 | **Ambient / Experimental / Downtempo** | dub, glitch, downtempo, IDM, trip-hop, lo-fi, footwork | ~1,040 |
| 4 | **House / Techno** | tech house, house, melodic house, melodic techno, g-house | ~505 |
| 5 | **Hip Hop / R&B** | jazz rap, alt R&B, alt hip hop, experimental hip hop, nu jazz | ~318 |
| 6 | **Classical** | classical, classical piano | ~183 |

**tl;dr**: Fundamentally a UK bass/DnB/jungle head with a strong ambient/experimental side. House is the *smallest* electronic bucket — playlists pushing into house are intentionally expanding his range.

## Analysis Methodology

Spotify killed audio features (BPM, energy, danceability) in Nov 2024, so genre-by-artist is the primary signal available.

```python
import sqlite3, spotipy
from collections import Counter

db = sqlite3.connect('/Users/sven/code/dj-buyer/state.db')  # adjust path
row = db.execute('SELECT access_token FROM spotify_auth LIMIT 1').fetchone()
sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth=row[0])

# 1. Fetch all liked songs (paginated)
all_tracks = []
offset = 0
while True:
    results = sp.current_user_saved_tracks(limit=50, offset=offset)
    items = results['items']
    if not items: break
    all_tracks.extend(items)
    offset += len(items)
    if len(items) < 50: break

# 2. Collect unique artist IDs
artist_ids = set()
for item in all_tracks:
    if item['track']:
        for a in item['track']['artists']:
            artist_ids.add(a['id'])

# 3. Batch-fetch artist genres (50 at a time)
artist_genres = {}
for i in range(0, len(artist_ids), 50):
    batch = list(artist_ids)[i:i+50]
    for artist in sp.artists(batch)['artists']:
        if artist:
            artist_genres[artist['id']] = artist.get('genres', [])

# 4. Count genre occurrences weighted by liked tracks
genre_counter = Counter()
for item in all_tracks:
    if item['track']:
        for a in item['track']['artists']:
            for g in artist_genres.get(a['id'], []):
                genre_counter[g] += 1

# 5. Top genres
for genre, count in genre_counter.most_common(40):
    print(f'{count:3d}  {genre}')
```

**Note**: Spotify tags *artists* not individual tracks. Each liked track gives +1 to all genres of all its artists. For per-track audio features (BPM, key, energy), use ReccoBeats API instead.
