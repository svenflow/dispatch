# Skillify

Analyze recent conversations to:
1. **Propose new skills** to automate recurring workflows, fill tool gaps, or build discussed ideas
2. **Suggest improvements to existing skills** based on user corrections, workarounds, and back-and-forth that indicates a skill's instructions are incomplete

## When to Use

- User says "skillify", "propose skills", "what should we automate"
- Nightly consolidation passes "--nightly" flag

## How It Works

### Step 1: Identify Active Sessions

```bash
cat ~/dispatch/state/sessions.json
```

- Filter to sessions active in the last 24 hours
- Include both 1:1 sessions and group chats, but for group chats only include those where the admin user is a participant (check the `participants` array)
- **IMPORTANT**: Some sessions have stale/missing `last_message_time`. Cross-check by reading recent messages for sessions with empty timestamps but known activity (e.g., sessions with "sven" in the name)
- Sort by most recent activity
- Cap at **10 sessions**

If no active sessions, report "nothing to analyze" and stop.

### Step 2: Discovery (Single Subagent — Holistic Cross-Chat Analysis)

Spawn **one discovery subagent** that reads ALL active session transcripts and identifies raw skill ideas. This must be a single subagent because skill opportunities often span multiple conversations.

The discovery subagent:

1. **Reads each transcript** sequentially:
   ```
   uv run ~/.claude/skills/sms-assistant/scripts/read_transcript.py --session {SESSION_NAME} --limit 50
   ```
   If a transcript read fails, skip it and note the skip.

2. **After reading ALL transcripts**, identifies skill opportunities using these signals:

   **HIGH SIGNAL — explicit automation intent:**
   - User explicitly asked for a tool/CLI/skill that doesn't exist
   - User brainstormed a tool in detail and deferred implementation
   - Examples: "I want a CLI that does X", "we should build a skill for this", "don't implement yet"

   **MEDIUM SIGNAL — implicit recurring need:**
   - User expressed frustration with manual work
   - Same category of work appearing across multiple chats (e.g., WebGPU benchmarking in one chat + WebGPU debugging in another = unified tooling opportunity)
   - Agent did lengthy manual work that a reusable script could handle
   - Existing skill was used but failed or needed workarounds
   - **A repeatable multi-step process was followed across chats** — even if it looks like "normal coding", ask: "Is this a process that could be applied to OTHER inputs?" If the same workflow (e.g., convert model → build shaders → benchmark → verify correctness) was done for Model A in one chat and Model B in another, that's a SKILL, not just coding.

   **SKIP:**
   - Truly one-off coding tasks (fixing a specific bug, adding a feature to a specific app)
   - One-off questions or tasks
   - Idle chat, greetings, jokes
   - Tasks already handled by existing skills

   **IMPORTANT — "normal coding" is NOT automatically a skip.** Coding that follows a repeatable process applicable to new inputs IS a skill opportunity. The question is: "Could someone say 'do this again but for X' and the same steps would apply?" If yes, it's a skill candidate.

   **SKILL IMPROVEMENT signals — look for these patterns that indicate an existing skill needs updating:**
   - User corrected the agent's behavior after a skill fired ("no, that's wrong, do X instead")
   - Lots of back-and-forth to get a skill-triggered action right (>2 corrections for one task)
   - User manually fixed or adjusted output from a skill-driven action
   - User provided extra instructions that should already be in the SKILL.md ("always do X when Y")
   - Workarounds that suggest missing edge cases ("it doesn't handle Z, so do this instead")
   - Agent apologized for doing something wrong that a skill should have prevented

3. **Returns TWO lists:**

   **a) New skill ideas** — each with:
   - `name`: kebab-case
   - `description`: 1-2 sentences
   - `signal`: high or medium
   - `evidence`: direct quote(s) from transcript(s)
   - `context`: 2-3 sentences on what user was trying to accomplish
   - `source_sessions`: list of session names this idea came from
   - `type`: "new_skill"

   **b) Skill improvement ideas** — each with:
   - `skill_name`: name of existing skill that needs improvement
   - `issue`: what went wrong or what's missing
   - `evidence`: direct quote(s) showing the correction/workaround/frustration
   - `suggested_fix`: what should change in the SKILL.md
   - `source_sessions`: list of session names
   - `type`: "skill_improvement"

### Step 3: Refinement (Parallel Subagents — One Per Idea)

For each raw idea from discovery (both new skills AND skill improvements), spawn a **refinement subagent** in parallel.

#### For new skill ideas, each refinement subagent:

1. **Checks existing skills** — reads `sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/p' ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` to get frontmatter for all ~65+ existing skills. Decides: is this idea already covered?

2. **Checks previous proposals** — reads `cat ~/dispatch/state/skillify-proposals.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"runs":[]}'`. Has this been proposed before?

3. **Makes a verdict**: **ACCEPT**, **REFINE**, or **REFUTE**
   - ACCEPT: idea is novel, reusable, and worth building as-is
   - REFINE: idea has potential but needs to be rescoped, narrowed, or reframed to be viable. The subagent rewrites the idea with a better framing and re-evaluates. For example: "too broad as stated, but if scoped to just X it becomes viable" → rewrite and accept
   - REFUTE: idea is a clear duplicate of an existing skill, or fundamentally not automatable. Must cite specific reason. **Be conservative with refute** — if there's any way to rescope the idea into something useful, use REFINE instead. Only refute for true duplicates or ideas that genuinely cannot be a skill.

4. **If accepted or refined**, fleshes out into a full proposal:
   - **name**: kebab-case
   - **description**: 1-2 sentences with trigger words (ready for SKILL.md frontmatter)
   - **seed_spec**: one sentence fully describing what to build — self-contained enough to hand off cold
   - **key_instructions**: 2-3 bullet points on core functionality
   - **complexity**: small (SKILL.md only) / medium (+ scripts) / large (+ external deps)
   - **source_sessions**: which session(s) this came from
   - **evidence**: direct quote(s)
   - **context**: 2-3 sentences
   - **overlap_check**: "Checked [skill-name]: not covered because [reason]" or "No similar existing skill"

#### For skill improvement ideas, each refinement subagent:

1. **Reads the existing skill's SKILL.md** — `cat ~/.claude/skills/{skill_name}/SKILL.md` to understand current instructions

2. **Evaluates the issue** — is this a real gap in the skill's instructions, or was it a one-off misunderstanding?

3. **Makes a verdict**: **ACCEPT**, **REFINE**, or **REFUTE**
   - ACCEPT: the skill's SKILL.md is genuinely missing guidance that caused the issue. Propose specific language to add.
   - REFINE: the issue is real but the fix needs to be reframed (e.g., the problem isn't the skill itself but how it interacts with another skill)
   - REFUTE: the issue was a one-off, the skill already covers this case, or the fix doesn't belong in the skill

4. **If accepted or refined**, produces an improvement proposal:
   - **skill_name**: which skill to update
   - **issue**: what went wrong
   - **proposed_change**: specific text to add/modify in the SKILL.md (show the actual language, not just "add error handling")
   - **evidence**: direct quote(s) showing the problem
   - **source_sessions**: which session(s)

5. **Returns** the verdict and proposal.

### Step 4: Rank, Persist & Present

Collect results from all refinement subagents:
- Drop refuted ideas
- Rank accepted proposals: high signal first, cross-chat patterns ranked higher, smaller complexity first
- Cap at **5 proposals**

**Persist** to `~/dispatch/state/skillify-proposals.json`:

```json
{
  "runs": [
    {
      "date": "2026-03-13",
      "proposals": [...],
      "sessions_analyzed": 5,
      "skipped_sessions": [],
      "refuted": [{"name": "...", "reason": "..."}]
    }
  ]
}
```

Append new run to the `runs` array. If more than 30 runs, drop the oldest.

**Present** results in two sections:

**## New Skills**
- Show new skill proposals with full details
- For each, end with: `To build: "build the [name] skill — [seed_spec]"`

**## Suggested Skill Improvements**
- Show improvement proposals with: skill name, issue, proposed SKILL.md change, evidence
- For each, end with: `To apply: "update [skill_name] — [proposed_change summary]"`

**Nightly mode** (prompt contains "--nightly"): Send the FULL report via SMS to admin so they can approve/deny when they wake up. Include everything — don't summarize or truncate:

```
🔧 skillify nightly — N new skills, M improvements

## New Skills

1. **skill-name** (signal, complexity)
Seed spec: [full seed_spec]
Key instructions:
- [bullet 1]
- [bullet 2]
Evidence: "[direct quote from transcript]"
Source: [session names]
Reply "build skill-name" to create it.

2. ...

## Skill Improvements

1. **skill-name** — [issue]
Proposed change: [specific SKILL.md language to add/modify — show the actual text]
Evidence: "[direct quote showing the problem]"
Source: [session names]
Reply "apply skill-name fix" to update it.

2. ...

## Refuted
- idea-name — [reason]
```

Show the FULL details for each proposal. The admin needs enough context to make approve/deny decisions without opening a laptop.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT create or modify any skill files. Propose only.**

#### Persist Results to Bus

**After generating the report (in ALL modes)**, publish a `scan.completed` event to the bus for historical tracking:

```bash
RUN_ID=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
~/dispatch/bus/cli.py produce system \
  '{"scanner":"skillify","run_id":"'"$RUN_ID"'","mode":"nightly","duration_seconds":DURATION,"summary":{"sessions_analyzed":N,"new_skills_proposed":N,"improvements_proposed":N,"refuted":N},"findings":[ACCEPTED_PROPOSALS_AS_JSON]}' \
  --type scan.completed --source skillify --key "scan-skillify-$RUN_ID"
```

The `findings` array should include all accepted new skill proposals and skill improvement proposals with their full details (name, description, seed_spec, evidence, source_sessions, etc.). Refuted items go in `summary.refuted` count only, not in findings.

This enables `bus reports --scanner skillify` to query historical scan results (stored in archive indefinitely).

### Step 5: Build on Request

When the user says "build [name]" or "build the [name] skill", look up the proposal in `~/dispatch/state/skillify-proposals.json`, use the seed_spec and key_instructions to build it via the skill-builder skill, and update the proposal's status to "built".

## Calibration Examples

### GOOD candidates (flag these):

1. **"I want a CLI that takes a model, converts to WebGPU, benchmarks, and compares outputs"**
   → name: model-to-webgpu, signal: high, complexity: large
   Why: explicit tool request, clearly reusable, specific enough to build

2. **Agent manually scraped 3 listing sites, parsed prices, compared — user said "do this daily"**
   → name: listing-scraper, signal: medium, complexity: medium
   Why: recurring multi-step workflow, user confirmed recurrence

3. **"we should have a thing that checks ski conditions across 4 mountains"**
   → name: ski-conditions, signal: high, complexity: medium
   Why: explicit request for a tool, clearly reusable during ski season

4. **Chat A: converted data from format X, validated output. Chat B: converted different data from format X, validated output the same way.**
   → name: data-format-converter, signal: medium, complexity: medium
   Why: BOTH chats follow the same process applied to different inputs. Even though it looks like "coding", it's a repeatable workflow. Ask: "could someone say 'do this again but for Z' and the same steps apply?" If yes, it's a skill.

5. **Agent set up CI/CD pipeline in 3 different repos the same way this week**
   → name: repo-ci-setup, signal: medium, complexity: medium
   Why: same process repeated across projects = skill opportunity

### BAD candidates (SKIP these):

1. **Agent fixed a specific bug in one repo** → truly one-off, no repeatable process
2. **"What's the weather?"** → one-off question
3. **"Turn on the lights"** → already covered by hue/lutron skills
4. **Agent read a file, edited it, ran tests for a feature** → one-off feature work, not a repeatable process

## Graceful Degradation

- **Transcript read fails** → skip session, note in skipped_sessions
- **Refinement subagent fails** → note failure, continue with other results
- **Zero candidates** → "no skill opportunities found today" (normal)
- **sessions.json missing** → report error, stop
- **proposals.json doesn't exist** → create with `{"runs": []}`
- **Context too large** → reduce --limit to 30 and continue

## Nightly Integration

Called by manager.py's nightly consolidation after person-facts and chat-context. Manager.py passes "--nightly" for SMS output mode. The manager.py hook is out of scope for this skill file.
