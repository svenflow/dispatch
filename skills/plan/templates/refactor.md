# Code Refactoring

## Goal
What's being refactored and why? What's the desired end state?

## Current State
- What does the code look like now?
- What are the pain points?
- What's the scope (files, modules, systems)?

## Target State
- What should the code look like after?
- What patterns/principles to follow?
- What should be easier after refactoring?

## Risks
- What could break?
- What tests need to pass?
- Rollback plan?

## Steps
- [ ] Identify all affected code
- [ ] Write tests for existing behavior
- [ ] Make incremental changes
- [ ] Verify tests pass
- [ ] Clean up
