# Bug Finder

Automatically discover bugs in any codebase using a 3-phase architecture: parallel discovery explorers, parallel refinement reviewers, and a compiled report.

## When to Use

- User says "find bugs", "what's broken", "check for bugs", "bug scan"
- Nightly cron via "--nightly" flag
- After a large merge or refactor to catch regressions

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Discovery (Parallel Explore Subagents)

Launch **4 parallel Explore subagents** simultaneously. Each focuses on a different bug surface area. All run with `subagent_type="Explore"` (fast, read-only) and `model="opus"`.

**IMPORTANT: All subagents (both discovery and refinement) MUST use `model: "opus"`.** Never use sonnet or haiku for bug finding.

**Scope:** The entire codebase is in scope for bugs, not just recent changes. Recent changes (last 24h) are the **primary signal** for where to focus exploration first, but explorers should also look at surrounding code, callers, integration points, and anything else that seems suspicious.

**Determine the target directory first:**
- If the user specifies a project/directory, use that
- If running from a git repo, use the repo root (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)
- Otherwise, default to `~/dispatch/` (the main system)

#### Explorer 1: Recent Code Changes

Prompt for the Explore subagent:

```
You are a bug discovery agent. Analyze {TARGET_DIR} for potential bugs, with recent code changes as your starting focus.

1. Find what changed recently (your PRIMARY focus area):
   git -C {TARGET_DIR} log --oneline --since="24 hours ago" 2>/dev/null
   git -C {TARGET_DIR} diff HEAD~5 --stat 2>/dev/null
   git -C {TARGET_DIR} diff HEAD~5 2>/dev/null

   If not a git repo, find recently modified files:
   find {TARGET_DIR} -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.sh" -mtime -1

2. For each changed file, read the FULL file (not just the diff). Also read callers and related files. Bugs can be ANYWHERE — not just in changed lines. Recent changes are your starting point but follow the code wherever it leads. Look for:
   - Logic errors (wrong conditions, off-by-one, inverted boolean logic)
   - Missing error handling (unhandled exceptions, missing null checks, no try/catch around I/O)
   - Edge cases (empty arrays, None/null values, empty strings, concurrent access)
   - Race conditions (TOCTOU, shared mutable state without locks)
   - Resource leaks (unclosed files, sockets, database connections)
   - Security issues (unsanitized input, hardcoded secrets, path traversal)
   - Regressions (deleted code that was needed, changed behavior without updating callers)
   - Documentation bugs in SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md (wrong commands, stale paths, incorrect instructions that would mislead future Claude sessions)
   - Markdown/config drift (SKILL.md describes behavior that the code doesn't match, or vice versa)

3. Return a JSON array of bug candidates:
   [
     {
       "id": "DISC1-001",
       "title": "Short description of the bug",
       "file": "absolute/path/to/file.py",
       "line_range": "42-58",
       "category": "logic_error|missing_error_handling|edge_case|race_condition|resource_leak|security|regression",
       "evidence": "The code does X but should do Y because Z",
       "severity_guess": "critical|high|medium|low",
       "confidence": "high|medium|low"
     }
   ]

Be thorough but precise. Only report things that are genuinely likely to cause incorrect behavior, crashes, or data loss. Do NOT flag style issues, missing comments, or theoretical concerns that require exotic conditions.
```

#### Explorer 2: System Health (Dispatch-specific)

**Only run this explorer when targeting ~/dispatch/ or the dispatch system.** Skip for other projects.

Prompt for the Explore subagent:

```
You are a system health bug discovery agent for the Dispatch personal assistant.

1. Run the debug CLI to check system health:
   debug status 2>/dev/null
   debug incident --since 24h 2>/dev/null

2. Check recent logs for errors:
   tail -100 ~/dispatch/logs/manager.log 2>/dev/null | grep -i "error\|exception\|traceback\|failed"
   tail -50 ~/dispatch/logs/session_lifecycle.log 2>/dev/null
   tail -50 ~/dispatch/logs/watchdog.log 2>/dev/null

3. Check for crashed or unhealthy sessions:
   cat ~/dispatch/state/sessions.json 2>/dev/null

4. Check bus for failed events:
   sqlite3 ~/dispatch/state/bus.db "SELECT datetime(timestamp/1000,'unixepoch','localtime'), type, key, payload FROM records WHERE type LIKE '%failed%' OR type LIKE '%crashed%' OR type LIKE '%error%' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20" 2>/dev/null

5. Look for patterns that indicate bugs:
   - Sessions that keep restarting (restart loops)
   - Messages that were received but never responded to
   - Heartbeat gaps (session went silent)
   - Error counts spiking
   - Memory/resource issues

6. Return a JSON array of bug candidates (same format as Explorer 1, but category can also be "system_health" or "operational"):
   [
     {
       "id": "DISC2-001",
       "title": "Short description",
       "file": "relevant file or 'system'",
       "line_range": "N/A for operational issues",
       "category": "system_health|operational|crash_loop|message_loss",
       "evidence": "What the logs/data show",
       "severity_guess": "critical|high|medium|low",
       "confidence": "high|medium|low"
     }
   ]
```

#### Explorer 3: Test Failures

Prompt for the Explore subagent:

```
You are a test coverage and failure discovery agent. Check {TARGET_DIR} for test issues.

1. Find test files:
   find {TARGET_DIR} -name "test_*.py" -o -name "*_test.py" -o -name "*.test.js" -o -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "*.spec.js" -o -name "*.spec.ts" 2>/dev/null | head -50

2. Find recently changed source files:
   git -C {TARGET_DIR} diff HEAD~5 --name-only 2>/dev/null | grep -v test

3. Check if changed files have corresponding tests. Flag files with no test coverage.

4. Try to run tests if a test runner is configured:
   - Python: look for pytest.ini, setup.cfg, pyproject.toml with [tool.pytest]. Run: cd {TARGET_DIR} && uv run pytest --tb=short -q 2>&1 | tail -50
   - Node: look for package.json with test script. Run: cd {TARGET_DIR} && npm test 2>&1 | tail -50
   - Shell: look for test scripts. Run them.
   Only run tests if a test framework is clearly configured. Do NOT install dependencies.

5. Return a JSON array of bug candidates:
   [
     {
       "id": "DISC3-001",
       "title": "Test failure or coverage gap",
       "file": "path to test or source file",
       "line_range": "if applicable",
       "category": "test_failure|missing_test_coverage",
       "evidence": "Test output or description of coverage gap",
       "severity_guess": "high|medium|low",
       "confidence": "high|medium|low"
     }
   ]

Prioritize actual test failures over missing coverage. A failing test is a confirmed bug signal.
```

#### Explorer 4: Consistency Issues

Prompt for the Explore subagent:

```
You are a consistency checker. Look for structural and reference integrity issues in {TARGET_DIR}.

1. Check for stale references and broken imports:
   - Read key entry points and check that imported modules/files exist
   - Look for references to files/paths that don't exist
   - Check for TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX comments that indicate known issues:
     grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX\|BROKEN\|WORKAROUND" {TARGET_DIR} --include="*.py" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.sh" 2>/dev/null | head -30

2. **Check markdown docs for bugs** (SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.):
   - Wrong commands or CLI usage examples (would fail if a future Claude session runs them)
   - Stale file paths that no longer exist
   - Instructions that contradict the actual code behavior
   - Incorrect descriptions of system architecture or data flow
   - Missing or outdated env vars, config keys, or API endpoints
   - These are REAL bugs — wrong docs mislead future Claude sessions and cause cascading failures

3. If this is ~/.claude/skills/ or dispatch:
   - Check that every SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter (--- delimited block with name and description)
   - Check that scripts referenced in SKILL.md files actually exist
   - Check that scripts are executable: find {TARGET_DIR} -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.py" | head -20, then check permissions

3. Check for configuration drift:
   - Are there .env.example files with keys not in .env?
   - Are there config files referencing paths/hosts that look stale?
   - JSON/YAML syntax errors in config files

4. Check for dead code indicators:
   - Files not imported/referenced anywhere
   - Functions defined but never called (check a few key files, don't exhaustively scan everything)

5. Return a JSON array of bug candidates:
   [
     {
       "id": "DISC4-001",
       "title": "Description of consistency issue",
       "file": "path to file",
       "line_range": "if applicable",
       "category": "broken_import|stale_reference|missing_file|config_drift|dead_code",
       "evidence": "What's inconsistent and why it matters",
       "severity_guess": "critical|high|medium|low",
       "confidence": "high|medium|low"
     }
   ]

Focus on issues that will cause runtime failures. A missing import that gets hit in production is critical. A TODO comment is informational.
```

### Phase 2: Refinement (Parallel Subagents — One Per Bug Candidate)

Collect all bug candidates from the 4 explorers. Deduplicate by file+line_range (if two explorers found the same issue, merge them and keep the higher confidence version).

For each unique bug candidate, spawn a **refinement subagent** in parallel. Use `subagent_type="general-purpose"` and `model="opus"` (these may need to run code or tests).

**Cap at 15 refinement subagents.** If more than 15 candidates, prioritize by: severity_guess (critical first), then confidence (high first), then drop the rest with a note.

Prompt for each refinement subagent:

```
You are a bug verification agent. Investigate this bug candidate and determine if it's real.

Bug candidate:
- ID: {id}
- Title: {title}
- File: {file}
- Lines: {line_range}
- Category: {category}
- Evidence from discovery: {evidence}
- Severity guess: {severity_guess}

Your job:
1. Read the relevant file(s) — the full file, not just the reported lines. Understand the context.

2. Try to determine if this is a real bug:
   - Trace the code path. Does the reported issue actually trigger in practice?
   - Check if there's error handling elsewhere that catches this case
   - Check if there's a test that covers this case
   - If possible, run the code or test to reproduce the issue:
     - For Python: uv run python -c "..." or uv run pytest path/to/test.py::specific_test
     - For Node: node -e "..." or npm test -- --grep "pattern"
     - For shell: run the script with safe test inputs

3. Make a verdict:
   - **ACCEPT**: This is a confirmed or highly likely bug. Explain the root cause, impact, and suggested fix.
   - **REFINE**: This needs more investigation — the code is suspicious but I can't confirm. Explain what's unclear.
   - **REFUTE**: This is NOT a bug. Explain why (e.g., handled elsewhere, intentional behavior, unreachable code path).

4. Return your verdict as JSON:
   {
     "id": "{id}",
     "verdict": "ACCEPT|REFINE|REFUTE",
     "title": "Final title (may be updated from discovery)",
     "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
     "category": "{category}",
     "file": "{file}",
     "line_range": "{line_range}",
     "root_cause": "Why this bug exists (ACCEPT only)",
     "impact": "What goes wrong when this bug triggers (ACCEPT only)",
     "reproduction": "Steps or command to reproduce (ACCEPT only, if possible)",
     "suggested_fix": "How to fix it (ACCEPT only)",
     "affected_files": ["list", "of", "files"],
     "reason": "Why this verdict (especially important for REFUTE)"
   }

Be rigorous. A bug must be something that causes incorrect behavior, crashes, data loss, or security issues under realistic conditions. Do not accept style issues, theoretical concerns requiring exotic conditions, or intentional tradeoffs documented in code comments.

**IMPORTANT: When fixing dead code or unused files/functions, recommend DELETION not deprecation.** Just delete the dead code — don't add deprecation warnings or keep it around "for reference." Dead code is noise.
```

### Phase 3: Report

Collect all refinement results:
- Drop REFUTE verdicts (note them in a "Refuted" section for transparency)
- Group ACCEPT verdicts by severity: critical > high > medium > low
- List REFINE verdicts separately as "Needs Investigation"

#### Report Format

```
## Bug Scan Report — {TARGET_DIR}
Date: {date}
Explorers: 4 | Candidates: {N} | Accepted: {A} | Refuted: {R} | Needs Investigation: {I}

### Critical

1. **{title}** — {file}:{line_range}
   Root cause: {root_cause}
   Impact: {impact}
   Reproduction: {reproduction}
   Fix: {suggested_fix}
   Affected files: {affected_files}

### High
...

### Medium
...

### Low
...

### Needs Investigation
- {title} — {file}: {reason for REFINE verdict}

### Refuted ({R} total)
- {title} — {reason}
```

#### Output Modes

**Interactive mode** (default): Print the report to the conversation.

**Nightly mode** (prompt contains "--nightly"): Send the full report via SMS to admin. Do NOT truncate or summarize — the admin needs full details to triage when they see it. Use the reply CLI or send-sms:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/sms-assistant/scripts/send-sms "{ADMIN_PHONE}" "{FULL_REPORT}"
```

Only send if there are ACCEPT or REFINE verdicts. If everything was refuted, skip the SMS and log "bug-finder nightly: clean scan, no bugs found."

**CI mode** (prompt contains "--ci"): Exit with non-zero status if any critical or high bugs are accepted. Print report to stdout.

#### Persist Results to Bus

**After generating the report (in ALL modes)**, publish a `scan.completed` event to the bus for historical tracking:

```bash
RUN_ID=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
~/dispatch/bus/cli.py produce system \
  '{"scanner":"bug-finder","run_id":"'"$RUN_ID"'","mode":"nightly","duration_seconds":DURATION,"summary":{"candidates":N,"accepted":A,"refuted":R,"needs_investigation":I},"findings":[ACCEPTED_AND_REFINED_FINDINGS_AS_JSON]}' \
  --type scan.completed --source bug-finder --key "scan-bug-finder-$RUN_ID"
```

The `findings` array should include all ACCEPT and REFINE verdicts with their full details (id, title, severity, category, file, root_cause, suggested_fix, etc.). Refuted items go in `summary.refuted` count only, not in findings.

This enables `bus reports --scanner bug-finder` to query historical scan results (stored in archive indefinitely).

## Graceful Degradation

- **Not a git repo** — Explorer 1 falls back to `find` for recent files, Explorer 3 skips "changed files" coverage check
- **No test framework** — Explorer 3 reports "no test framework found" and only checks for test file existence
- **debug CLI not available** — Explorer 2 skips (it's dispatch-specific anyway)
- **Explorer subagent fails** — Continue with results from other explorers. Note the failure in the report.
- **Refinement subagent fails** — Note the failure, don't count as accepted or refuted
- **Zero candidates** — Report "clean scan, no bug candidates found" (this is a good outcome)
- **Too many candidates (>15)** — Refine top 15 by severity+confidence, list the rest as "unreviewed" in report

## Calibration

### GOOD bug candidates (report these):
- `if x > 0` when it should be `if x >= 0` — logic error, will cause off-by-one
- File opened but never closed in error path — resource leak
- `except Exception: pass` silently swallowing errors — missing error handling
- Import references a module that was renamed/moved — broken import
- Test expects value A but code now returns value B — test failure = confirmed bug
- Session restart loop detected in logs — operational bug
- SKILL.md says "run `foo --bar`" but the script doesn't accept `--bar` flag — doc bug that misleads future sessions
- CLAUDE.md references a file path that was moved/deleted — stale reference causes errors
- SKILL.md describes a 3-step process but code actually does 4 steps — drift between docs and implementation

### BAD candidates (do NOT report):
- "This function doesn't have type hints" — style, not a bug
- "This variable name is unclear" — style
- "This could theoretically overflow if given 2^64 items" — unrealistic edge case
- "No test for this utility function" — low-value coverage gap
- "This TODO says 'fix later'" — known issue, not a discovery
- "This function is long" — complexity, not a bug

## Examples

```bash
# Scan dispatch system for bugs
"find bugs in ~/dispatch"

# Scan a specific project
"find bugs in ~/code/my-project"

# Nightly automated scan
"find bugs --nightly"

# After a big refactor
"find bugs in the recent changes to ~/dispatch/assistant"
```
